# genki  - microservice toolkit

> Enki (ð’‚—ð’† ) is the Sumerian god of knowledge, crafts and creation. 
> Combine it with the awesome Go language, and you get Genki, my personal microservice toolkit.

---
> This framework was initially developed by me; but it is now maintained as a fork by my buddy: [marcoEgger/genki](https://github.com/marcoEgger/genki)
>
> I suggest using the fork because this repo is not maintained anymore.
